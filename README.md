# cmd-plants

## Overview
This project is an experimental attempt to use GitHub Copilot to generate a Python script that creates ASCII art representations of flowers and trees in the terminal. The goal is to explore how AI-assisted development can help create visually interesting console-based plant visualizations. Also for someone who has not used Copilot before, I am attempting to learn how use this AI tool to its maximum ability. This is also leading me into a project to get a local AI model running on my own machine and attempting work with it as well.

## Project Goals
- Generate ASCII art representations of various flowers and trees
- Display them in the terminal with proper formatting
- Use GitHub Copilot to assist in the script development process
- Create an extensible system for adding new plant types

## Features
- ASCII flower generation
- ASCII tree generation
- Console-based visualization
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

## Development Approach
This project leverages GitHub Copilot's AI capabilities to accelerate development and explore creative solutions for generating plant ASCII art. The development process involves:
1. Defining plant structure concepts
2. Using Copilot to generate ASCII patterns
3. Refining output for better visual representation
4. Testing various plant designs

## Project Structure
- `flowers.py` - Flower ASCII art generation
- `trees.py` - Tree ASCII art generation (if applicable)
- `garden.py` - Main garden/display management
- `clean_garden.py` - Utility for cleaning or resetting the garden display

## Getting Started
Run the script to generate ASCII plants in your terminal:
```bash
python garden.py
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add more plant varieties
- Improve ASCII art quality and detail
- Add color support for terminal
- Create interactive plant growth simulation
- Add configuration options for customization
